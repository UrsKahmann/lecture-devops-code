Tutorials
=========


These tutorials are intended to be small and __optional__ hands-on tasks that are being
worked on during class. Ideally, every lecture topic (weekly) comes with one or more
corresponding tasks.

Performing these tasks should help you to familiarize yourself with technologies you
might be going to use in your [exercise assignment](https://github.com/lucendio/lecture-devops-materials/tree/master/assignments/exercise.md).

The tutorials vary a bit in their workload but still cover a small scope. Solutions may only
utilize the basics of the technologies that are involved, while their capabilities would reach
far beyond that.

For more comprehensive tutorials either refer to the
[link collection](https://github.com/lucendio/lecture-devops-materials/tree/master/links.md) or 
to a web search you find least untrustworthy.

Each directory contains a 

a) `README.md` describing the tutorial and
b) sub-directory containing a `README.md` with the steps for on possible solution (and *assets* if needed)
